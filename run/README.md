# Scripts and base toml files for charm baryon studies

# Running

Activate the `charm` conda environment using `conda activate charm`
Run the program using 'sh main.sh'
This will do the full analysis of this study --- this is required in order to get masses ---
Plots in the paper will be put in ../paperPlots
x-y-yerr data in those plots will be in ../plotXYData in csv files. It is reccomended you understand the code rather than use these directly.

# Experimental Masses
Experimental masses can be found in
`charmBaryonExpSurveyUsed_AVERAGED.csv`
They have been averaged over charge sector and uncertainties of multiple particles added in quadrature.
